## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Font styles

### What I learned

The major learning from this challenge was to match the font styles. I've learned properties like letter-spacing, line-height but never used them. I also used flex gap property and box-shadow. I also learned to use PerfectPixel chrome extension to make the design more perfect.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.description {
  margin-top: 15px;
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 50%);
  font-size: smaller;
  letter-spacing: .005em;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to learn more about box-shadow, font styles and also wants to be more comfortable on using flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [PerfectPixel](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi?hl=en) - This helped me for making my design perfect reason. I really liked this extension and will use it going forward.
- [Box-Shadow by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JNRQ5HjNeI) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me finally understand box-shadow. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
